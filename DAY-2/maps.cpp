#create key to value mapping
#not continuous just they arein pair
#store the value in sorted order
#we cannnot insert dupicate key in map it will replace its current value by old value 
#e.g m[5]='abc' m[5]="cde"so o/p will be 5 cde
#complexity depends on keys s,size()*log(n)
#unordered (no maintainance of order)
#uses hash table so complexity is  o(1 )
